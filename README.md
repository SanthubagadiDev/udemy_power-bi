# 📊 Udemy Courses Analysis using Power BI
---
## 📌 Project Overview
---
This project focuses on analyzing Udemy course data to understand course popularity, learner behavior, and market trends using **Power BI**. 
The goal is to help instructors and stakeholders make data-driven decisions about course creation, pricing, and category selection.

The analysis covers course categories, levels, pricing models (free vs paid), subscriber engagement, and category saturation. Since course ratings were not available in the dataset, number of reviews was used as a proxy for course quality and learner engagement.
